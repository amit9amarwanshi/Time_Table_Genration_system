A college timetable is a arrangement of a set of lecture and classroom in  which all given constraints are satisfied . Creating such timetable manually  is complex and time consuming process . By automating this process with  computer assisted timetable generator can save a lot of precious time of  administrator who are involved in creating and managing course  timetables .  Since every college has its own timetabling problem the commercially  available software packages may not suit the need of every college .  Hence we have developed an approach for building lecture course  timetabling system which can be customized according to colleges  timetabling problem and its needs . This project introduces a practical  timetabling algorithm capable of taking care of both strong and weak  constraints effectively used in an automated timetabling system so that  each teacher and student can view their timetable once they are finalized  for a given semester and it can be customized according to their needs  and priorities . The workload on all teachers should be uniform . The  teachers who is assigned with the subjects having practical session  where  should not be engaged with other slots while the practical  session is going on.  In addition to arranging courses and exams in a timetable, there is the  task of providing students with an adequate and balanced workload  during their course of study. Exam timetable is for teachers and students  to know about exam schedule along with seating arrangement of  students .
